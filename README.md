# RUST_turret

The Rust Turret Project was developed by two enthusiasts from different continents who were forced to leave their homeland due to military actions directed at our native home.

The project is inspired by the idea of turning dreams into reality and is still under development.

The turret is built on a Raspberry Pi Pico W board, using CircuitPython 9.0.5 (as of now). It also utilizes a Max98357 sound board, a 2-watt speaker, a standard laser module, a DAOKI HC-SR505 PIR sensor, and two SG90 servo motors.

All 3D models, except for the AK-47 model which was taken from a public model library, were designed by us from scratch. The mechanism, wiring scheme, code, and program logic were also created and developed by our small team of two.

Thank you for your interest in our project.
